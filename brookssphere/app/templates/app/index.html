        <h2>What Does This Site Do?</h2>
        <p>This site has no "real" functionality. When you login, you'll have the opportunity to save, retrieve, edit, and delete essentially random pieces 
        of information to the database. The only purpose is to show beginners what's happening behind the scenes. </p>
        <p>
            This site is built with Python (Django Rest Framework) for the backend, JavaScript (React framework) for the frontend (with lots of pre-generated CSS),
            and a PostgreSQL Database.

        <h2>Different Levels</h2>
        <p>For each piece of information, you'll see 2 levels of detail.</p>
        <p>Level 1 is the simple stuff, perfect for people who are learning the foundations of full-stack web development. </p>
        <p>Level 2 goes a bit more in-depth. If you already have the basics down, this will drill into how functionality is implemented.  </p>
